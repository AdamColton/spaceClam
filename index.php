    <h1>The Antodo Space Clam</h1>
    <p>Welcome everyone to the start of a grand adventure to rescue/destory the Antodo Clam otherwise known as the
    Grand/Terrible Space Clam. Shown below are my demo's during development. I make no guarentee that any of them work.</p>
    
    <p><a href="stateDemo.php">State Demo</a> - I introduced game state late in development of my zombie game and it had
    to be sort of wedged in. This time I wanted a state manager established early.</p>
    <p><a href="starDemo.php">Star Demo</a> - Draws a moving stars background</p>
    <p><a href="movementDemo.php">Movement Demo</a> - Move the hero around the screen. I now have the Fire and Charge (as well as Base) hero states working.
    Press F to fire and A to charge. Your acceleration is severaly decreased in Charging mode, you should be able to tell. You start with 4 energy, so you
    can fire 4 shots. After that you will have to charge up your energy to fire more shots.</p>
    <p><a href="enemyDemo.php">Enemies Demo</a> - Enemies that move around, get shot at, collide.</p>
